<p style="line-height:35px">
	Selling hair was just going to be our side hustle. We had never intended for it to be this big movement.
	But a BIG movement is exactly what Curl Me Crazy created. 
	During our school project, we found our talent decided to take a leap of faith. With just $500 we purchased some business cards, a few bundles of hair and an LLC under the name Curl Me Crazy. 
	What at first started as a school project became a booming business. 
	Through the use of social media Curl Me Crazy created a following that fell in love with our authentic personalities and marketing techniques not seen before to sell hair. 
	With almost 1,000,000 followers on Instagram and seeing ourselves as our only competition, Curl Me Crazy has solidified itself as a force to be reckoned with in the hair industry. 
	We continue to push the boundaries when it comes to creating unique experiences for our audience. 
	Lending our knowledge through classes and books, Curl Me Crazy is empowering and inspiring other people to create their own lane and venture into entrepreneurship in the beauty industry. 
	Team5 has been featured in Ebony, Black Enterprise, Rollingout, The Source, Black Hair, Sheen and more. 
	What does the future hold for Curl Me Crazy? The possibilities are endless.
