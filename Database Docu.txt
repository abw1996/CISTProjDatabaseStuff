Hey Team,

For the database the tables are as follows with current restrictions in place

Appointments
	AppointmentNumber (int any length)
	AppointmentDT (datetime)
	EmployeeID (string fixed length of 6)
	CustomerID (string fixed length of 9)

Customers
	CustomerID (string fixed length of 9)
	FirstName (string variable length max 30)
	LastName (string variable length max 30)
	CustomerPN (string fixed length of 10)
	CustomerEmail (string variable length max 60)
	customerPW (string variable length max 18)

Employees
	EmployeeID (string fixed length of 6)
	FirstName (string variable length max 30)
	LastName (string variable length max 30)
	EmployeePN (string fixed length of 10)
	EmployeePW (string variable length max 18)


For customer logins, I am thinking of using customer email for username and for employees they would use their ID.
